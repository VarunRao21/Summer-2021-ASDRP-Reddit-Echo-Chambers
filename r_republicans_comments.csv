5,joblessthehutt,1454781520.0,,,t2_uhq4z,"I voted twice for Obama, and will never vote for another Democrat.

1 - ACA is a deeply flawed law. It does not work and needs to be repealed or *massively* overhauled. 

2 - The United States is less secure than at any point since the Cold War. Obama has not lead the world in the battle to contain radical Islam. Iran is stronger than ever; and our allies in Europe stand poised to collapse. 

3 - Obama promised to promote transparent government, and has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any other administration in history. The battle for government transparency is now set back by decades, and may be lost forever. The next administration will follow the precedent. The American voter may never again be informed.

4 - the bailout was bad policy, and has set up the economy for an even bigger crash down the road. It is inevitable that the ghost of 2008-2009 will return to haunt us.

5 - by slashing America's military, our enemies are emboldened. Russian skirmishes and Chinese incursions prove that the balance of power is slipping away. 

6 - Obama promised to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, and has not. This perpetuates a national human rights embarrassment.

7 - Obama has not meaningfully reigned in unwarranted domestic spying. This, too, is a national human rights embarrassment.

8 - Obama bungled the troop withdrawal in Iraq. The region will be destabilized for decades, and hundreds of thousands will die. 

9 - Obama has ignored our veterans. 

10 - Obama has lead the charge into petty identity politics, damaging the cohesive fabric of the American national community. We are less united today than we have been in decades. This is an abject failure to live up to his campaign promise to unify the people and bridge inroads in our national racial divide. 

11 - Obama has utterly failed to lead Congress. Congress has never been so ineffective for so long.

12 - Obama abused the IRS to target political opponents, setting a terrible precedent for future abuse.

13 - Obama's economic policy has done nothing to help the domestic worker. Wages remain stagnant; unemployment remains high. Only Wall Street cronies are doing well. 

14 - Obama has pushed TPP and TTIP, two disastrous trade agreements that will decimate America's already weakened middle class. 

15 - Obama's campaign promise to rebuild America's infrastructure is utterly unfulfilled. 

16 - Obama has waffled on much-needed immigration reform; offering no solutions and failing to lead. Our weak borders destabilize our national security. 

17 - Obama's Iranian nuclear deal is a disaster; destroying any hope that may have existed for a diplomatic solution for Israel in the region.

18 - Obama has repeatedly drawn lines in the sand and then retreated. This sends the message to extremists that America is weak. 

19 - Obama has used secret drone strikes to kill American citizens, without any due process. This amounts to a secret assassination program, and belongs in history books right next to the Gestapo.

20 - Libya

21 - The Snowden Affair, and Chelsea Manning

22 - zero meaningful education reforms; desperately needed.

23 - $29 trillion national debt

24 - Benghazi

25 - Spying on the Associated Press

26 - Fast and Furious project arms violent Mexican drug cartels. Thousands die.

27 - OPM is hacked, exposing every single federal employee with a security clearance -- only the worst of several high profile cyber assaults Obama's administration failed to prevent

28 - Eric Holder commits perjury before Congress. Twice.

29 - Hillary Clinton commits perjury before Congress.

30 - Obama funnels federal dollars into failed green energy firms. His pals get rich. America gets screwed.",0.0,1462218518,,0.0,d2q1drf,t3_4hie36,1.0,t3_4hie36,12514.0,1465587554,53,False,republicans,t5_2r4xl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1462219876.0,,
