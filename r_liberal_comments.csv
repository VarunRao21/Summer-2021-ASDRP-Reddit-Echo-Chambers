*edit*


Ok, so what the source has said is that he didn't know for a fact that the recording was turned off, BUT that he thought it was curious that a recording/ transcript doesn't seem to exist. This is from his twitter, linked above (sorry, you'll have to dig a bit.)

13,Dixzon,,,"I have a good story for you to hear. It is about the coal mining industry in and around Scranton, Pennsylvania and how it came to an end.  Scranton is my home town, so I know quite a bit about it.  The coal there is known as anthracite coal.  It is quite rare, there are only a few places on Earth where anthracite coal is known to exist, and it is the [highest quality coal.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracite#/media/File%3AIbbenbueren_Anthracite.JPG)The coal mining and railway industries used to be booming in Scranton. It got one of its nicknames, Steamtown, because of all the trains coming and going.  

But this boom was not without a price.  My parents and grandparents used to tell stories about [huge mountains of coal that were always on fire for years and years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracite#/media/File:Burning_Culm_Dump,_Scranton,_PA.jpg)  They probably didn't know it, but those fires would have released significant amounts of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which cause cancer, and a fair amount of radiation and other contaminants such as lead or SOx gasses.  The network of mining tunnels became so extensive that cave ins were becoming more and more frequent, sometimes damaging or destroying homes.  Eventually the mining companies got so greedy they decided to break the law in their quest for quarterly profits, and they dug a new tunnel under a river in the area.  That tunnel flooded, and it was connected to mine shafts around the area that were lower in elevation than the river.  The entire river was diverted and it flooded a large portion of the area and destroyed an enormous amount of property.

It was only after that point that the people of Scranton understood the real cost of coal mining, and they decided to stop mining.  Billions of tons of anthracite coal, the rarest highest quality coal in the world, sit unmined and undisturbed there to this day.

I am a scientist by profession, a physical chemist, and I can tell you [there is another flood coming if we do nothing.](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/map-shows-sea-level-rise-will-drown-american-cities/)  many republicans are in denial about it, but If this same anti-science idiocy had taken over the republican party in the 80's, Reagan would never have signed the Montreal Protocol, the ozone layer would have been destroyed, and we'd all be getting skin cancer today.  Even back then conservative voices like Rush Limbaugh were saying institutions like the National Academy of Sciences were wrong about the ozone layer.  Guess who was proven right in the end?

37,kinokonoko,,,"&gt; From reading the comments it seems like a large amount of semi-normal conservatives are starting to lean into extremist views and ideologies. It's spreading.

Keep in mind that right-wing propagandists, and the organizations that seek to use them, use bots and fake accounts/followers to **create the illusion** that they are a growing movement, and that their numbers are greater than they really are.  

The fear and anxiety you are feeling is the goal.  It makes you feel less safe to assert your values, be public about your rights and beliefs, and to feel less confident that your surrounding community shares your values.

The world of social media, and the internet, is not real, and does not represent the majority of people out there.  

Even with the State's complicity, any kind of armed insurrection would fail.  Who would do all the work that is required to keep, hold and develop all this land?  Immigration, slavery and importation of skilled labor would have to be started again, because none of these laptop warriors want to work the long hours it would take to make their Vanilla Utopia a reality.

The problem you're facing is that misinformation often takes facts or statements made and either intentionally misses the context of combines them in nonsensical ways to create a new, erroneous, narrative.

The second problem you're facing is your dad has not stopped watching the propaganda, and even knowing some isn't credible he'll likely continue to believe it in the face of all evidence.

It also means you're doing a job of a fact checker, which is time consuming and difficult. If you're going to continue doing this I suggest you line up websites that specifically debunk claims made: politifact, snopes, etc. You'll have the benefit of their analysis and the go back to source material for context, assuming there is any.
