2,Jeffylew77,1373824736.0,,,"2018 Russia Investigation Current Tally:

Guilty By Trial: 
- Paul Manafort (Trump’s Political Consultant) (8 Charges) (10 Charges Mistrial)

Guilty By Federal Judge:
- Alex van der Zwann (Worked with Rick Gates and Paul Manafort) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty:
- Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor) (1 Charge)
- Rick Gates (Trump’s Political Consultant) (2 Charges)
- Michael Cohen (Trump’s Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair) (8 Charges)
- George Papadopoulos (Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel) (1 Charge)
- Samuel Patten (Associate of Paul Manafort and Cambridge Analytica) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty (Wanted To, But Denied Guilty Plea):
- Paul Manafort (Tried getting guilty plea after his first trial (Found guilty on 8 charges while the 10 other charges are still ongoing). My opinion/guess is He was denied because Mueller’s team probably already knows what he was going to tell them.

Recused:
- Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)

Granted Immunity:
- David Pecker (CEO of National Enquirer/Trump’s friend) (Pecker claims there is a safe of decades of damaging stories of Trump. Rachel Maddow touched on how the National Enquirer repeatedly put out anti Hillary cover stories. “Control the medium, control the message.”)
- Allen Weisselberg (CFO of Trump Organization)
- Andrew Miller (Roger Stone’s Aide)

Granted Immunity (Manafort Trial):
- Donna Duggan (Moody Insurance Worldwide Employee)
- Conor O'Brien (Former KWC employee)
- Cindy Laporta (Paul Manafort’s Accountant)
- James Brennan (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)
- Dennis Raico (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)

A. This investigation is ran by Democrats!
- President is Republican
- House is Republican majority
- Senate is Republican majority
- Rod Rosenstein is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican
- Robert Mueller is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican 

B. This doesn’t have anything to do with Russia!
- The investigation is still ongoing (We’re only 1.5 years into the Trump presidency. Watergate took 2 years.)
- Paul Manafort has another trial a separate trial in September. I wonder what that could be for?
- Michael Cohen said explicitly he has evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government. Treason is a crime and a crime treated by capital punishment aka the death penalty.
- TRUMP'S Campaign manager, TRUMP'S National Security Advisor, TRUMP'S Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel, TRUMP'S Political Consultant, and TRUMP'S Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair were all indicted. The TRUMP Organization CFO got an immunity deal. The National Enquirer CEO, TRUMP'S good friend, also got an immunity deal. AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP? Everyone in he has surrounded himself has either flipped, found guilty by trial, found guilty by a federal judge, plead guilty, recused themselves from the Russia Investigation, or has been granted immunity.
- Why are you so quick to dismiss someone of possible crimes?

C. Cohen's Guilty Plea from the Justice Department states (Says he has evidence to prove):
https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax

- “The plea was entered followed the filing of an eight-count criminal information, which alleged that COHEN concealed more than $4 million in personal income from the IRS, made false statements to a federally-insured financial institution in connection with a $500,000 home equity loan, and, in 2016, caused $280,000 in payments to be made to SILENCE TWO WOMEN who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, thereby intending to influence the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.""

- “The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, Title 52, United States Code, Section 30101, et seq., (the “Election Act”), regulates the influence of money on politics.  At all relevant times, the Election Act set certain limitations and prohibitions, among them: (a) individual contributions to any PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, including expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee, were limited to $2,700 per election, and PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES and their committees were prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals in excess of this limit; and (b) Corporations were prohibited from making contributions directly to presidential candidates, including expenditures coordinated with candidates or their committees, and candidates were prohibited from accepting corporate contributions.""

- “COHEN caused and made the payments described herein in order to INFLUENCE the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  In so doing, he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.  As a result of the payments solicited and made by COHEN, neither Woman-1 nor Woman-2 spoke to the press prior to the ELECTION.”


D. George Papadopoulos on Jeff Sessions and Russia:
- “While some in the room rebuffed George's offer, MR. TRUMP NODDED WITH APRROVAL and deferred to Mr. Sessions who appeared to like the idea and stated that the campaign should look into it” - Defense Attorneys for George Papadopoulos (Former Foreign Policy Adviser, who plead guilty in trying to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin)


E. George Papadopoulos on Russia Trump-Putin Meeting:
- “I actively sought to leverage my contacts with the professor to host this meeting. The CAMPAIGN WAS FULLY AWARE OF WHAT I WAS DOING, including Corey Lewandowski (Former Trump Campaign Manager) and Sam Clovis (Trump Campaign Aide/Former  Under Secretary of Agriculture for Research, Education, and Economics For United States Department of Agriculture).”

Here are the options:
Option #1: Everyone in Trump's inner circle, opponents of Trump, and anyone that speaks negatively of Trump is a liar, according to Trump? 
Option #2: Trump is a liar and a criminal﻿.





Things TRUMP’S White House hires have said about their boss, TRUMP:
- “A fucking moron” - Rex Tillerson (Former Secretary of State)

- “An idiot. ""It’s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He’s gone off the rails. We’re in Crazytown. I don’t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I’ve ever had” - John Kelly (Chief of Staff)

- “An idiot and a dope” - H.R. McMaster (Former National Security Advisor)

- “An idiot surrounded by clowns” - Gary Cohn (Former Chief Economic Advisor)

- “He’s like an 11 year old child” - Steve Bannon (Former Chief Strategist)

- “An empty vessel when it comes to things like the constitution and rule of law” - Scott Pruitt (Former Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency)

- “His mental decline could not be denied” - Omarosa Manigault-Newman (Political Aide)

- “Fucking liar” - John Dowd (Former Personal Lawyer)

73,gumout,1389098564.0,,,"The gif isn’t quite right. Martha Stewart was friends with the president of a company called Imclone. He told Martha that some bad news was coming (a new product was failing FDA approval or something). Martha (understandably) called her broker and told him to dump the stock. From what I recall the sale was about the number in the gif, but the gain (the amount she would not have lost had she don’t nothing) was about $50k. 

I don’t think Martha considered what she was told was non-public information when she called her broker. When she found out that it was non-public that’s when she came up with the cover story about the stop-loss order. (This is the crime) It was complete BS. She got called on it and went to jail, lost millions in value and cred, but on the bright side learned how to knit. 

What she SHOULD have done (life lesson here) was day Yes, I screwed up. I didn’t consider that my friend was telling me non-public info. I’m sorry. How about I donate that $230k to charity and double or triple that and say mea culpa. But nooooooo. She came up with a story and stuck with it and went to jail. 

Bringing us to today. What will Icann say? This will be investigated by the SEC. Learning the lesson of Martha will not really help. Talking to POTUS about an unannounced steel tariff couldn’t be argued away in the same way.
